&lt;h3&gt;Experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FXR | Winnipeg, Manitoba | Store Supervisor | 03/2019-Current&lt;/strong&gt;
I started working there as a store assistant and cashier. As I became more familiar with the store, I took on more roles, such as closing and opening the store. This included counting tills, unlocking and locking the store, ensuring all employees were there and working on time, and making sure everything was ready for the day. I also dealt with any complications with customers and employees when the managers were not in the store. Over the five years I have been there, I have gained much knowledge about the store and its products, and I have been entrusted to do much, even at times running the store when the managers are on vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paramount Computers | Winnipeg, Manitoba | Computer Contractor | 01/2023-11/2024&lt;/strong&gt;
I worked here in a group with four others, where we were given contracts from companies and were creating and fixing their user interfaces. During this job, I was starting my second year of computer science at university, so I had a lot less knowledge than my colleagues. My role was to do all the tedious tasks, and learn from others. Over the year I was there, I learned a lot about group work, communication, and how to learn from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YMCA | Winnipeg, Manitoba | Lifegaurd/Swim Instructor | 09/2017-03/2019&lt;/strong&gt;
I began working there as a lifeguard, where I observed swimmers on the pool deck, ensuring no problems ensued. Over the first year of working there, I learned from others, and began swimming lessons. I even gained certification to teach swimming lessons to help create other lifeguards. I had to create plans and interact with many people, which helped strengthen my organization and communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;
